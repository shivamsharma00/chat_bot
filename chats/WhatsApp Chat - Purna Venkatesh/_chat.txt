[2/19/22, 8:58:52 PM] Shivam Sharma: A deep neural network is made up of a series of layers. Each layer is made up of a forward computing function and the parameters that go with it. The number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer determine the model's size. As previously mentioned, model parallelism is used for big Deep Neural Networks that don't fit in one machine's local memory. This means that various sections of the model are placed on multiple machines. Each layer's parameter will be matched to the associated machine. Model parallelism training is a bi-directional process. For processing one mini-batch, it has a forward and backward path.
[2/19/22, 8:59:04 PM] Shivam Sharma: batch parallelism to pipe the execution of each set of small batches across cells. The overall memory use and pipeline utilization can be used to assess the efficiency of pipeline parallelism. The percentage of pipeline stages that are not idle (stalled) at any particular time is known as pipeline utilization (Util). Pipeline parallelism can be separated into synchronous and asynchronous pipelines, similar to data parallelism, based on their update strategies.
[2/19/22, 9:42:17 PM] Purna Venkatesh: A sequence of layers make up a deep neural network. Each layer consists of a forward computing function and its associated parameters. The size of the model is determined by the number of layers and neurons in each layer. Model parallelism is utilized for large Deep Neural Networks that don't fit in one machine's local memory, as previously explained. This means that different parts of the model are distributed over numerous machines. The parameters of every layer will be matched to the machine with which it is related. Model parallelism training is a conjoint process. It has a forward and backward path for processing one mini-batch.
[2/19/22, 9:42:25 PM] Purna Venkatesh: Across cells, Batch parallelism will pipe the execution of every set of small batches . The efficiency of pipeline parallelism can be measured by looking at overall memory usage and pipeline utilization. Pipeline utilization(Util) is the percentage of pipeline stages that are not idle (stalled) at any given time. Pipeline parallelism, like data parallelism, can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous pipelines based on their update techniques.
